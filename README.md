# Necromanced Bosses
Necromanced Bosses is a mod that adds items such as swords, bows, pickaxes, axes and many more! It also adds bosses! Such as Necromanced Eye of Cthulhu, Necromanced King Slime, Necromanced Skeletron and more!

## A wiki
This mod is really new and in fact we don't have an official "wiki". But we have a trello that you can access by clicking [here](https://trello.com/b/ekFIIi0e/necromanced-bosses)!

## The devs
We are currently 2 persons working on this project.
Tobicontinued, my friend, is a spriter, and I am the only dev.

As you can guess, I'm searching devs and spriters to help me in this incredible quest. I hope you'll join us in!

### License
This mod is under ***no*** license. But you can guess it doesn't mean you can steal the sprites freely. DM me on Discord if you want the permission to use our sprites.
